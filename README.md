# Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer

A high-performance JavaFX application that brings Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to life.  
Generate large, complex graphs in seconds and watch the algorithm work step-by-step, with clear visual cues for node settlement, edge relaxation, and optimal path discovery.
